The cards will provide us with a way to emphasize on the important pieces of information & be able to seperate them from the body content

basic-card: The Basic card will only be used for information that might include a button but never a link.

icon-card: The Icon card will be used for things like calls-to-action on the homepage or highlights on the inside page.
